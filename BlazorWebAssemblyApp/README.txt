Staffline test
--------------
Existing Blazor test app to connect to our internal API

But I had to  remove all the internal API Packages for this demo

    <!--<PackageReference Include="FP.ApiClient" Version="20220318.1.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="FP.Domain" Version="20220419.1.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="FP.ExcelReader" Version="20220413.1.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="FP.ViewModel" Version="20220419.1.0" />-->

    As this was only a POC for using blazor, not much of the above libraries is in use yet
    
    So I can get by by putting all the missing work into one new project call it FP.MissingLink

    Fix all compile errors and run
